Made by: Rihards Dzerkals, Group 1.
Task explanation:
1. Read a set of integers into a vector. Print the sum of each pair of adjacent elements. Change your program so that it prints the sum of the first and last elements, followed by the sum of the second and second-to-last, and so on.
2. Read a sequence of words from cin and store the values a vector. After youâ€™ve read all the words, process the vector and change each word to uppercase. Print the transformed elements, eight words to a line. (Hint: use <cctype> library to convert symbols to uppercase)
3. Write a program that uses a while to sum the even numbers from 50 to 100.
